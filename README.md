# Own Portfolio

## Description

This project represents a webpage about myself and my work portfolio. It was created to showcase my projects completed throughout the edX Web Development bootcamp and future work sample. 

### Acceptance Criteria for this project were: 
1. When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
2. When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
4. When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
5. When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
6. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Usage

The webpage can be accessed using this URL: https://anadomuta.github.io/challenge-own-portfolio/

To use the webpage, you can click on the different sections in the navigation bar and get to the desired content section. 

The webpage is responsive on small and medium screens.
